This application was created for the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's Westside Atlanta Preservation initiative. The organization needed to speed up the acquisition process for historic properties that would be rehabilitated and resold to the Atlanta Land Trust as permanent affordable housing.

**Technology:** this application was created with Node and Express. Because of large storage requirements and to facilitate maintenance by GTHP, this application is run and hosted locally and accessed through a browser.
